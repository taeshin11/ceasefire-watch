    q: 'What is Ceasefire Watch and who is it for?',
    a: 'Ceasefire Watch is a free, publicly accessible intelligence platform that tracks active ceasefire negotiations, peace agreements, and violation reports in conflict zones worldwide. It is designed for journalists, researchers, policy analysts, students, NGO workers, and anyone with a professional or personal interest in understanding global conflict dynamics. No registration or payment is required to access any feature of the platform.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Where does the data on this platform come from?',
    a: 'Our data is sourced from a combination of publicly available datasets and reports including the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), United Nations agencies, official government sources, and verified open-source intelligence. Each data entry aims to cite its primary source where possible.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How frequently is the data updated?',
    a: 'Data update frequency varies by category. Breaking conflict events and active frontline data are updated as new verified information becomes available, typically within 24-48 hours of an event. Statistical summaries and aggregate figures are reviewed and updated on a weekly or monthly basis. The "last updated" timestamp on each data section indicates when that specific data was most recently refreshed.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this platform free to use? Are there any premium features?',
    a: 'Ceasefire Watch is entirely free to use. We believe conflict intelligence should be accessible to everyone, not just those with institutional subscriptions. We sustain the platform through advertising revenue. There are no paywalls, premium tiers, or registration requirements. All data visible on the platform is fully accessible to all visitors.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I use or cite data from Ceasefire Watch in my research or reporting?',
    a: 'You are welcome to reference and cite data from Ceasefire Watch in your work, provided you credit the platform and, where available, the original primary source. We recommend always cross-referencing our data against primary sources for academic or professional publications. If you are a journalist, researcher, or organization interested in a data partnership or bulk data access, please contact us at contact@ceasefire-watch.vercel.app.'
