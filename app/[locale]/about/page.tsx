              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ceasefire Watch was built on a single conviction: that access to timely, accurate conflict intelligence should not be limited to governments, think tanks, or expensive subscription services. We believe that journalists, researchers, policy analysts, students, and engaged citizens all deserve access to the same quality of information to understand the world&apos;s most pressing security challenges.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">In a world where armed conflicts shape economies, displace populations, and determine the course of history, we are committed to making conflict data accessible, transparent, and useful for anyone who needs it.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">What We Track</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ceasefire Watch provides tracking of active ceasefire negotiations, peace agreements, and violation reports in conflict zones worldwide. Our platform aggregates, verifies, and presents this data in a format designed for clarity and usability, so users can quickly understand the current situation and track changes over time.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We cover active conflicts across multiple regions, providing data visualizations, timelines, and detailed analysis that contextualizes raw numbers within broader geopolitical realities.</p>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Our Data Sources &amp; Methodology</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our data is compiled from a range of publicly available sources including: official government reports and military briefings, United Nations agencies (OCHA, UNHCR, WFP), established academic conflict databases (ACLED, SIPRI, Uppsala Conflict Data Program), verified open-source intelligence (OSINT) from credentialed researchers, and reporting from internationally recognized news organizations.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We prioritize source transparency and where possible, cross-reference multiple sources before publishing figures. Where sources disagree, we aim to present the range of estimates rather than a single contested figure.</p>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Why This Matters</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">Conflict data is inherently sensitive and often politically contested. We recognize this complexity and strive to present information in a factual, non-partisan manner. Our goal is not to advocate for any particular political position, but to ensure that accurate information is available to support informed discussion, humanitarian response, and evidence-based policy. The numbers we track represent real human lives — and that responsibility guides everything we do.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Our Team &amp; Background</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The platform was developed by a team of data engineers, journalists, and security researchers passionate about making conflict intelligence accessible to the public. Our backgrounds span open-source intelligence (OSINT), data visualization, and international security studies.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We are not affiliated with any government, military organization, or political group. Our work is funded entirely through advertising revenue, which allows us to remain independent and freely accessible to all.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">How We Differ From Traditional Media</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Traditional news media covers conflicts reactively — a story today, silence tomorrow. Ceasefire Watch provides continuous, structured monitoring that persists beyond news cycles. Where newspapers provide narrative, we provide data. Where TV coverage provides emotion, we provide quantified context.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">Our structured data format also makes it easy for researchers to track trends over time, compare conflicts across regions, and identify patterns that would be invisible in unstructured reporting.</p>
